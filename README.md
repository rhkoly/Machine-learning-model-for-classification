# Machine-learning-model-for-classification

The Data (WineData-red) used for this project is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ . In this project three different machine learning models are implemented respectively Random Forest classification, Support vector classification and Neural network. Classification is done based on the quality of the Wine(good if greater than 5.5 otherwise bad).
