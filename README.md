# Machine-learning-model-for-classification
Using Scikit -Learn for Machine Learning 
The Data (WineData-red) used for this project is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ . In this project three different machine learning models are implemented respectively Random Forest classification, Support vector classification and Neural network. Classification is done based on the quality of the Wine.
